# Sphelper

Sphelper is a Javascript-based utility for Starfinder (an pen-and-paper RPG from Paizo) players. The goals of this project are two-fold. The first is to provide a straightforward tool to enable review and searching of the extensive spell list. The second is to marry that list to a known-spell-list builder for spellcasting players and NPCs alike.

The name 'Sphelper' comes from the awkward combination of the words 'Spell' and 'Helper'.

This repository holds the code that enables Sphelper to function. If you would like to _use_ this, you can simply visit [https://hectate.github.io/sphelper/index.html] to do so.

## Getting Started

Sphelper is intended to work in a browser as a static webpage (it does not require server-side processing). As a result, simply hosting the files from a repository is usually enough to generate a working instance of Sphelper. It is also possible to run it locally in the filesystem.

### Prerequisites

This repository is designed as the complete package of files required to run Sphelper, locally or over the internet on a host. As a result, the only other thing required is a capable browser.

### Installing

Download the repository's files to a directory somewhere on your computer. Open ``index.html`` in your preferred browser. You may now use Sphelper in that browser, locally.

If hosting online, you should upload the repository's files to your host. Once they are served to authorized clients (e.g. publicly or internally, etc), the client's browser has Sphelper loaded and ready for use.
