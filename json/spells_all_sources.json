(If you carry an artifact, you decide which body retains it). You exist in two places at once until the spell ends. Once the copy is created, it can travel an unlimited distance away from you. Your duplicate acts just after you do each round—it doesn’t have a separate initiative count. One of you can use a full round’s worth of actions, and the other can take only a standard or a move action. Between the two of you, you can cast only one spell per round—unless you have a special ability that allows you to cast more than one spell when you have no duplicate, such as the quickened spell magic hack. You and your duplicate share sensory information, so if one of you is aware of or knows something, both of you do. The duplicate is another creature for most purposes, with the following exceptions. You and the duplicate use the same statistics and share resources, including one pool of consumable items (including ammo), daily-use abilities (including from items) and spell slots, Hit Points, Resolve Points, and Stamina Points. If your duplicate casts a spell, your spell is expended, and if your duplicate uses a consumable item, that item is no longer available to you. Similarly, if an item one of you carries is permanently lost or destroyed, that item is lost or destroyed for both. Attacks, spells, and effects affect the two bodies as though they were one person, taking the worst effect applicable. For example, if both bodies are in the same explosive blast, you attempt the saving throw only once and take the damage only once. If you fail the saving throw against hold person, both bodies are paralyzed, and if one body catches a disease, both do. Both bodies count as one creature for spell effects, and they can’t be chosen more than once for such effects. Any magical effect on you has its duration halved while you’re bilocating. For example, the aforementioned hold person loses 2 rounds of duration each round it paralyzes you and your duplicate. Similarly, if you cast resistant armor on yourself, your duplicate is also affected, and the spell has a duration of 5 minutes per level. An effect that has its duration shortened in this way lasts a minimum of 1 round. In addition, if you attempt a skill check to recall knowledge, you roll only one check. Similarly, if you and your duplicate are in the same area, you roll only one Perception check to determine what you’re both aware of, although you receive a +2 bonus to this check as if your duplicate aided you on it.

    "longText": "You can alter the atmosphere within the spell’s area to cause it to become more like the atmosphere of another planet. You can alter one aspect of the atmosphere—its corrosiveness, density, or toxicity. The possible effects of each of these changes are detailed below. Corrosiveness: You can make the atmosphere corrosive. Each creature and object in the area when you cast the spell must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 5d6 acid damage. Creatures and objects that remain in the area take 3d6 additional acid damage every 10 minutes (Fortitude half). Alternatively, you can make a normally corrosive atmosphere noncorrosive. In this case, the atmosphere within the spell’s area deals no acid damage for the duration of the spell. Density: You can make the atmosphere in the area one step thinner (going from severely thick to thick, thick to normal, normal to thin, or thin to severely thin) or thicker (going from severely thin to thin, thin to normal, normal to thick, or thick to severely thick). The spell cannot make an atmosphere thicker than severely thick or thinner than severely thin. In addition to the normal long-term effects of being in an atmosphere thinner or thicker than a creature is acclimated to, each creature in the area of the spell when it is cast must succeed at a Fortitude save or suffer the immediate effects described below. This is true even for creatures with environmental protection from equipment (such as armor), as the air within the armor is affected on a failed saving throw. Creatures that do not need to breathe are not affected by changes in atmospheric density. If the air is thicker than a creature is acclimated to, on a failed saving throw, that creature becomes sickened. For every step beyond the first that the air is thicker than the target’s acclimation, it takes a –1 penalty to its save against this effect. If the air is thinner than a creature is acclimated to, on a failed saving throw, it is fatigued. For every step beyond the first that the air is thinner than the target’s acclimation, it takes a –1 penalty to its saving throw against this effect. The effect ends if the creature moves out of the area, and it is not required to attempt a new saving throw upon reentering the area (instead it is subject only to the normal dangers of thicker or thinner air). Toxicity: You can make the atmosphere toxic. Each creature in the area of the spell when it is cast must succeed at a Fortitude save or suffer the immediate effects described below. Creatures with environmental protection from equipment already active (such as armor) are not exposed to the toxic atmosphere. A creature that fails its save contracts bubonic plague (no save) and immediately moves to the weakened state. Creatures that enter the area of toxic atmosphere later are exposed to inhaled bubonic plague and follow the normal disease rules for contracting the disease and progressing on the physical disease track. The disease is nonmagical, and those infected are still infected when the spell’s duration ends. Alternatively, you can make a normally toxic atmosphere nontoxic. In this case, the atmosphere within the spell’s area does not expose those who breathe it to any toxic disease for the duration of the spell.",

This movement acts as the teleport spell, except there is no chance of missing your destination. When attempting to enter or exit a computer with one or more countermeasures, you automatically trigger any countermeasures that are not successfully disabled. When you emerge from a computer, you can attempt one Computers check, with the result compared to the DC of each countermeasure in place on that computer (this does not require an action); you suffer the effects of all countermeasures with a DC higher than the result of your check.

Any flying target has its maneuverability worsened by one step (from average to clumsy for example; minimum clumsy) and plummets to the ground unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Acrobatics check to fly to remain in the air. An area of zero-g works like the zero-g environment (see page 402). You can also use this spell to make areas of zero-g heavy gravity or light gravity act as normal gravity for the duration (see page 402).",

Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like abilities just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled. You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways as a targeted dispel or as a counter. [Targeted Dispel] One creature object or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as zone of truth). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way or otherwise uniquely identify it (such as that burning wall or the spell that's giving him those duplicates). Attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the spell's caster level. If you succeed the spell ends. If you don't specify a spell and there is more than one possible spell on the target your targeted dispel attempts to dispel a spell at random. If you target a force an object or a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as unseen servant) you attempt a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item you attempt a dispel check against the item level (DC = 11 + the item level). If you succeed all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. A magic item's nonmagical physical properties are unchanged; a suppressed holy laser pistol is still a laser pistol. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You can choose to automatically succeed at your dispel check against any spell you have cast. [Counter] You can use the energy of dispel magic to disrupt the casting of other spells. First select an opponent and take the ready action (see page 249) to cast dispel magic when that target casts a spell. This is considered a purely defensive action. When that readied action is triggered you cast dispel magic and must attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) to counter the other spellcaster's spell.

Additionally greater dispel magic has a chance to dispel any curse that remove affliction can remove even if dispel magic can't dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse's DC. [Area Dispel] When greater dispel magic is used in this way the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst.

A creature drawn into the singularity can take no actions except a full action to try to escape (it still takes damage during the rounds it attempts to escape). A creature must succeed at either an Athletics check (DC (CASTERLEVEL+CASTERLEVEL/2+15)) or a DC 22 Strength check to escape the singularity. The singularity can hold up to four Medium creatures or objects (two Small creatures or objects count as one Medium creature and so on); if it would pull in additional creatures those creatures are simply pulled into a square adjacent to the singularity. A creature within 50 feet of the singularity has its speed reduced by half when it moves away from the singularity. However it can move at double its normal speed when moving toward the singularity. If a creature moves within 30 feet of the singularity at any point in its movement it is subject to the combat maneuver described above. A creature that moves neither toward nor away from the singularity moves at its normal speed.

Make a ranged attack against each successive target's EAC in turn; the disk deals 2d6 force damage to each secondary target struck (this damage is rolled separately for each target). The disk continues to ricochet in this way until it has attempted to strike five creatures or until there are no more valid targets or until you voluntarily end the spell. A creature can take damage only once from a single casting of this spell. The forcedisk is subject to spell resistance so you must attempt a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level) against each target with spell resistance before determining whether the target might take damage. If you fail this check the spell ends. The exact shape of the forcedisk is superficially changeable; as part of casting this spell a spellcaster can decide to make it shaped differently from a traditional disk.

If the target's soul is not willing to return the spell fails; therefore a target that wants to return receives no saving throw. Casting this spell requires a special monument worth at least 1000 credits to serve as a beacon for the departed creature's soul. This object is consumed when you cast the spell. Since the dead creature is returning in a new body all physical ills and afflictions are removed. The condition of the creature's remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists it can be reincarnated but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready the target is reincarnated. A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class features feats and skill ranks it formerly had. Its class base attack bonus base save bonuses and Hit Points are unchanged. The creature should recalculate its ability scores from scratch as a member of its new race (remembering to include any ability score increases from leveling up). The target of the spell gains 2 permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the target is 1st level it takes 2 Constitution drain instead (if the Constitution drain would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less the creature cannot be reincarnated). The target creature can decide whether its new body retains any of the implants it had in its former body. A spellcasting creature has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell. For a humanoid creature the new incarnation is determined using the table on the facing page. For nonhumanoid creatures a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created. Elementals outsiders and undead creatures can't be reincarnated. Any creature that can't benefit from the mystic cure spell cannot be reincarnated. The spell can bring back a creature that has died of old age. The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form including any forms of movement and speeds natural attacks extraordinary abilities and the like but it does not automatically speak the language of the new form it takes.

Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. In the region of shadow you move at a rate of 200 miles per hour. Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore when the spell effect ends you are shunted 1d10 * 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no saving throw). Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow (except for the Drift) but this usage requires you to travel across the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality which takes 1d4 hours.",

[Combat Maneuver] Once per round you can use telekinesis to perform a ranged attack that acts as a bull rush disarm grapple (including pin) or trip combat maneuver. Resolve these attempts as normal but use your caster level plus your key ability score modifier as your attack bonus. No saving throw is allowed against these attempts but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last (CASTERLEVEL) rounds but it ends if you cease concentrating. [Sustained Force] A sustained force moves an object of no more than (CASTERLEVEL*25) pounds or (CASTERLEVEL*2) bulk up to 20 feet per round in any direction (including up or down). A creature can negate the effect on an object it holds with a successful Will save or with spell resistance. This version of the spell lasts (CASTERLEVEL) rounds but it ends if you cease concentrating. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the spell's range. You can telekinetically manipulate an object as if with one hand. For example a lever can be pulled a key turned a button pushed an object rotated and so on if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots though a delicate activity such as this requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence check. [Violent Thrust] The spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl up to 15 objects or creatures that are within range (no two of which can be more than 10 feet apart) toward any target within 150 feet of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 400 pounds or 40 bulk. You must make attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items using your base attack bonus plus your key ability score modifier as your attack bonus. All objects cause damage ranging from 1 damage per 25 pounds or 2 bulk (for less dangerous objects) to 1d10 damage per 25 pounds or 2 bulk (for extremely dangerous objects such as weapons or bladed or spiked objects). Objects and creatures that miss the target land in a square adjacent to the target. Creatures that fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled but they can attempt Will saving throws (or rely on spell resistance) to negate the effect as can those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a thrown creature is hurled against a solid surface it takes 1d6 damage as if it had fallen 10 feet.",

As the caster you need not attempt a saving throw nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use by another creature receive saving throws and benefit from spell resistance. You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy can make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works roll d% and consult Table 10-1. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table. [Familiarity] Very familiar describes a place you have been very often and where you feel at home. Studied carefully describes a place you know well either because you can currently physically see it or because you've been there often. Seen casually describes a place you have been to more than once but with which you are not very familiar. Viewed once describes a place you have seen once in person or have extensively studied through scrying magic remote cameras or recorded images (for a remote-viewed location you still need to have a clear idea of the location; you can't teleport to an unknown location that you've seen in a holovid). False destination describes a place that doesn't truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location it is a place that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table rather than rolling d% since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from. {On Target] You appear where you want to be. [Off Target] You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. The distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly. [Similar Area] You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range the spell simply fails instead. [Mishap] You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten scrambled. You each take 2d10 damage and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls roll 1d20+80. Each time mishap comes up the creatures take more damage and must reroll. [TELEPORTATION RESULTS] Very familiar - 1-97 On Target 98-99 Off Target 100 Similar Area; Studied Carefully - 1-94 On Target 95-97 Off Target 98-99 Similar Area 100 Mishap; Seen Casually - 1-88 On Target 89-94 Off Target 95-98 Similar Area 99-100 Mishap; Viewed Once - 1-76 On Target 77-88 Off Target 89-96 Similar Area 97-100 Mishap; False Destination - 81-92 Similar Area 93-100 Mishap;",

A xenodruid mystic instead uses crystals and incenses worth 30000 credits. This magically alters the area's climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain but it doesn't affect creatures or the configuration of the ground. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees but it doesn't flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment. You can alter the climate by one step (cold temperate or warm). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM but in general it changes to a similar terrain type or by one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth from a shallow bog to a deep bog and so on). Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration. This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change the type of bordering terrain and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis.
